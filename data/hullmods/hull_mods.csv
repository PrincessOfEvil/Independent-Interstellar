This can only be done to cruisers, or, theoretically, capitals, due to activation energy requirements.

Increases speed while phased by %s. Phase slipping due to high flux is completely removed. Increases phase flux by %s.

All crew, including officer staff and AI cores, is required to put on phase-shielded suits while phase coils are in use. No punishment for breaking this rule is required.","Massively increases speed while phased, at the cost of flux.",,graphics/hullmods/augmented_drive_field.png

Usually, only a small amount of these systems are used if a smaller weapon is installed, since it physically cannot use them all. But, with a reasonably small modification to the weapon, these systems can be used even on smaller weapons for a small power boost.
